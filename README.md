# Wordle Word Search
 Wordle Word Search helps you Wordle better by giving you a list of available words based on the letters you have narrowed down
## How to Use
* Type in any letters you know are in the word, and type in periods where you don't know the letter. The letters you type in will automatically show up as green, but you can click on them to turn them orange. Type in any letters you know aren't in the word in the input field. Hit the X button to clear your search in both the input field and the word and clear any search results.
  * Make sure to put your green AND orange letters in the correct place. Even though the orange letter doesn't specify a correct place, it does specify an incorrect place, and this code considers that. If you have tested the orange letter in multiple places, put the orange letter in all of the places you have tested it in, unless you've found the green letter for that location.
* Hit the Enter key or button to enter your search, and you will receive a list of words to choose from for your next turn. To keep this as a fair but not overpowered resource, there are currently no plans to implement sorting based on the frequency at which characters appear in the English language.
* Hit the X button to clear everything, or just change your search and hit enter again to refresh your search
## Known Issues
* Support for multiple of the same orange letters(currently treats it as if there is only one orange letter)
## Features To Add
* How To Use panel
